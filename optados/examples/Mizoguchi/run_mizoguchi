# This is a file that runs the miz_chemical_shift script
#
# Here we are using all of the miz_chemical_shift flags in order to
# calculate the chemical shift to the absorption energy for a file
# named NaGe on a core hole on a Ge atom. We have previously done
# a singlepoint calculation to determine that the 
# E-TS groundstate energy is -11848.48889250 and are using that as 
# our groundstate energy. This is also shown in the file
# NaGe-singlepoint.castep. The executable we are using is called 
# castep.serial and is on our $PATH. This will run a castep
# DRYRUN calculation and then write a file called NaGe-mizoguchi.out
# Which has all the details of the calculation including if it failed
# 
# The singlepoint energy of -11848.48889250 eV is calculated from a 
# singlepoint calculation without a charge and without a core hole
# on the same cell as in NaGe.cell. See the NaGe-singlepoint.* files 
# for details
#


../../tools/miz_chemical_shift -i NaGe -e Ge -t -11848.48889250

# Alternatively we could uncomment the following and search for the 
# groundstate energy in our file NaGe-singlepoint.castep
# 
# ../../tools/miz_chemical_shift -i NaGe -e Ge -s NaGe-singlepoint

# Both of the above methods should yield the following Mizoguchi 
# chemical shift in the last line of NaGe-mizoguchi.out
